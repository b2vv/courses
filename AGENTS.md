# Working in courses

## Scope and delivery
- Read the repository briefing first: [work/CTO-RESEARCH.md](work/CTO-RESEARCH.md). It caches primary sources; where it disagrees with the code, the code wins and the briefing is rewritten.
- Foundation and public catalog (Phases 1–2) are complete. Current delivery: Identity (Phase 3).
- Phases 4–8 remain roadmap work; do not claim working admin CRUD, playback, uploads or payments.
- Read `docs/identity/plan.md` and `work/tasks.md`; execute one logical slice at a time.
- Preserve existing work. Never commit secrets, `.env`, media bytes or dependency caches.
- Use small logical commits and record current-phase verification, limitations and next task in `docs/identity/report.md`.

## Architecture
- Backend modular monolith with a separate media-worker executable. No Rust, ORM or service locator.
- Domain: standard language only; no framework, database, transport or external packages.
- Application: domain and ports only. Ports may reference domain. Adapters point inward.
- Framework wiring belongs to composition roots. Handlers/routes translate transport and render; business policies live inward.
- Generated sqlc/Orval models stay in adapters and map explicitly to domain entities.
- Ports require an actual external dependency. Document future seams before adding unused interfaces.
- No global mutable clients/stores. SSR dependencies and Query caches are request scoped.
- Nginx serves media bytes; Go and SSR never proxy them. Foundation media access is denied until authorization exists.

## TypeScript
- Strict TypeScript; no `any` or assertions that disguise unsafe input. Validate external data.
- TanStack Start + Rsbuild/Rspack, React Aria, Query for server state, Router search params for URL state.
- No Vite, Next, Vitest, Jest, ESLint, Axios, Redux Toolkit, Radix or shadcn.
- No fetch in presentation/routes, no server state in Zustand. Add dependencies only when used.
- Semantic design tokens; keyboard navigation, visible focus, >=44px controls, light/dark, 200% text zoom.

## Verification
- `make format-check`, `make lint`, `make typecheck`, `make test`, `make integration`, `make build`, `make e2e` in that order.
- Unit tests at domain/application boundaries; repository tests against isolated Postgres; contract tests at HTTP; browser tests against Compose.
- Do not represent skipped or blocked checks as passed. CI fails if Docker integration cannot run.
- Explicit business error codes; no secrets in logs, URLs logged without query strings.
